# xstatuspp
xstatuspp (executable xspp) is a spin on xstatus in C++.  xspp is the location of future development on xstatus.  It is also a testing area for learning C++ and exploring language features, as I have been on hiatus from C++ programming for about 15 years.  Considering the widget-based nature of the xstatus toolbar, an object oriented restructuring of the project seems appropriate.
## TODO
* Implement configurable launcher buttons
* Implement menus
* Implement a calendar widget
* Implement a pager compatible with jbwm
